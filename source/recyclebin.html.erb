    <h2>“Venus, can you do a new sign for our recycle bin?”</h2>
    <p>The very first task in K2 is to re-design the sign for a recycle bin. K2 is a very eco-friendly company with a recycle bin in the office, hoping everyone can help the world by recycling.</br>
      Boss said the old design of the sign doesn’t match with the style of K2 (as a design company), so they need a new design of it. </p>
