    <h1>ANNUAL DINNER</h1>
    <h2>“Venus, do you wanna join us to annual dinner?”</br>
      perhaps you can get creative with our interactive projector!”</h2>
      <h2>It’s the 5th Anniversary of The Bees. And the representative of K2  was chosen as the designer for the annual dinner. We are required to design the theme and all the graphics for annual dinner.</br>
        My responsibility in this task is to refine the backdrop, design for the photobooth and designing the props.</h2>

        <p>Me and K ( the designer) is working as a team for this backdrop design. He did came up with a brief idea of using a hand as the theme of this design. However, we want to experience more, so i work with some other design for it.
          After receiving comments from K, I did amended the design and ask for his comment again. After this never-ending process of back and forth, K decided to use his original design with some modification.

          The rumor of : people always choosing for the first design IS REAL! </p>

              <p>This is the project that I enjoyed the most! So glad that I can work with designer- K. He gave me a lots of room for creative. I may get stuck some time, K will just send me some references for brainstorming. And also, designer-K and A showed me a lot of tricks of using illustrator, which is really usful to me! </br>
                It feels great to challenge yourself and succeed in it. I was doing 3D blender in less than a week, and composing a complicated paper model in 2 days. </br>
                So glad that K2 made something for annual dinner, it’s important to be contributed in workplace, it motivates you.</p>
